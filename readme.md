# Instagram Feed Mock-up
Replicated version of Instagrams Feed after user logs in while in dark mode.

## Motivation
Wanted to put the skills I had acquired to use by attempting to imitate what I saw in response to different screen sizes (not including mobile) and without Javascript. Icons are not exactly the same, but close enough to give the same meaning as the ones on Instagram.

## Built With
HTML5 and CSS

## How to Use
For this particular project, there is not a lot the user can do to interact with the feed.

However, you can change your screen size to see the changes that occur with the layout: and scroll down if necessary.
